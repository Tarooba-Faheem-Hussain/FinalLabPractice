Practice:

Environment.NewLine is a platform-independent and language-independent way to represent a line break.
Alternatives are \n in C# and vbCrLf in Visual Basic.

The dollar sign ($) in front of a string lets you put expressions such as variable names in curly braces
 in the string. The expression value is inserted into the string in place of the expression.
 This syntax is referred to as interpolated strings.


	Console.WriteLine("What is your name?");
	var name = Console.ReadLine();
	var currentDate = DateTime.Now;
	Console.WriteLine($"{Environment.NewLine}Hello {name} on {currentDate:d} at {currentDate:t}!");
	Console.Write($"{Environment.NewLine}Press any key to exit...");
	Console.ReadKey();

Use Debug build configuration:
Debug and Release are Visual Studio's built-in build configurations. You use the Debug build configuration for debugging and the Release configuration for the final release distribution.


⦁	On the Build menu, click Build Solution (or press Ctrl + SHIFT + B).
You now have a project with methods you can test. In this article, the tests focus on the Debit method. The Debit method is called when money is withdrawn from an account.
